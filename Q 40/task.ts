// Task (40)
// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a
// music album.The function should take in an artist name and an album title,
// and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
// Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.   
// Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks
//  on an album. If the calling line includes a  value for the number of tracks, add that
// value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes 
// the number of tracks on an album.

// Define the Album interface
interface Album {
    artist: string;
    title: string;
    tracks?: number;
}

// Known artists array
const knownArtists: string[] = ["Atif Aslam", "Talha Anjum", "Azaan Sami Khan", "Ali Zafar"];

// Function to create an album object
function make_album(artist: string, title: string, tracks?: number): Album {
    if (!knownArtists.includes(artist)) {
        console.log(`Warning: The artist ${artist} is not in the list of known artists.`);
    }

    let album: Album = {
        artist: artist,
        title: title
    };

    if (tracks !== undefined) {
        album.tracks = tracks;
    }

    return album;
}

// Create three albums without tracks information
let album1 = make_album("Atif Aslam", "Meri Kahani",12);
let album2 = make_album("Talha Anjum", "Open leter",13);
let album3 = make_album("Azaan Sami Khan", "Main Tera",9);

// Print the albums to show they store the information correctly
console.log(album1);
console.log(album2);
console.log(album3);

// Create an album with tracks information
let album4 = make_album("Ali Zafar", "Huqa Pani", 17);

// Print the album with tracks to show the tracks information is stored correctly
console.log(album4);

// Create an album with an unknown artist to demonstrate the use of includes
let album5 = make_album("Unknown Artist", "Mystery Album");

// Print the album with an unknown artist
console.log(album5);
